DREAM Interface Module

This module provides interfaces and utilities for working with the DREAM
(Disruption Runaway Electron Analysis Model) code. DREAM simulates the
physics of tokamak disruptions including Thermal Quench, Current Quench,
and runaway electron generation.

Main components:
    - configurator: Setup of DREAM simulation parameters
    - runner: Execution interface for DREAM simulations
    - extractor: Output extraction from DREAM results
