DINA Interface Module

This module provides interfaces and utilities for working with the DINA
plasma scenario simulator. DINA solves the free-boundary Grad-Shafranov
equation and 1D transport equations to simulate tokamak plasma evolution.

Main components:
    - scenario: Configuration and setup of DINA scenarios
    - runner: Execution interface for DINA simulations
    - extractor: Signal extraction from DINA outputs
